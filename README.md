As a buyer of enterprise SaaS products, determining a fair price is challenging, especially with sellers often positioning their products at high prices regardless of market realities. While buyers have budget constraints, sellers aim to maximize revenue, leading to tension over what constitutes a fair value. To address this, you can develop a predictive pricing model that balances the interests of both parties. With SaaS products typically offering a 60%-80% margin for negotiation and customers generally satisfied with a 15%-20% discount, the model can help buyers identify a fair price for negotiation, leveraging customer ratings from platforms like G2 and AWS Marketplace to benchmark value for money.
This is Problem Statemnet given to me I am asked to predict software price using Machine Learning. Since I couldn't find a suitable dataset, I created one using ChatGPT. The dataset includes 11 features, all described in the "description.txt" file. 
My analysis, model development, and related work are documented in the "softwire_pricing.ipynb" notebook.
Additionally, I've developed a Streamlit application, with the implementation in the "app.py" file.
